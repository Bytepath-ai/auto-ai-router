# Analysis of the Nested Compound Model Separability Bug

## Problem Summary

When creating nested compound models in astropy, the separability matrix is incorrectly computed. Specifically:

- `m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)` correctly shows diagonal separability
- `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)` correctly shows separability
- `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & (m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))` incorrectly shows all inputs as non-separable

## The Issue with `_cstack` and `_coord_matrix`

Based on the bug behavior, here's what's likely happening:

### 1. How Separability Should Work

For the compound model `A & B`:
- The inputs are concatenated: `[A_inputs, B_inputs]`
- The outputs are concatenated: `[A_outputs, B_outputs]`
- The separability matrix should show which inputs affect which outputs

For example, with `Pix2Sky_TAN() & Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)`:
```
Inputs:  [0, 1, 2, 3]  (Pix2Sky takes 0,1; Linear1D(10) takes 2; Linear1D(5) takes 3)
Outputs: [0, 1, 2, 3]  (Pix2Sky outputs 0,1; Linear1D(10) outputs 2; Linear1D(5) outputs 3)

Separability matrix:
[[True,  True,  False, False],  # Output 0 depends on inputs 0,1
 [True,  True,  False, False],  # Output 1 depends on inputs 0,1
 [False, False, True,  False],  # Output 2 depends on input 2
 [False, False, False, True]]   # Output 3 depends on input 3
```

### 2. The Problem with Nested Models

When we have `Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` where `cm = Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)`:

The `_cstack` function likely:
1. Receives the separability matrix for `Pix2Sky_TAN()` (a 2x2 matrix)
2. Receives the separability matrix for `cm` (already computed as a 2x2 matrix)
3. Needs to combine them into a 4x4 matrix

The bug appears to be in how it positions the pre-computed matrix for `cm` in the final matrix.

### 3. Why `_cstack` Fails

The `_cstack` function probably has logic like:

```python
def _cstack(left, right):
    if isinstance(left, np.ndarray) and isinstance(right, np.ndarray):
        # Both are already matrices - need to combine them
        # BUG: This case doesn't properly handle positioning
        pass
    elif isinstance(left, Model) and isinstance(right, Model):
        # Both are simple models - compute from scratch
        # This works correctly
        pass
    elif isinstance(left, np.ndarray) and isinstance(right, Model):
        # Mixed case - also potentially buggy
        pass
```

The issue is that when `right` is already a compound model with its own separability matrix, the function doesn't correctly position this matrix in the larger combined matrix.

### 4. The `_coord_matrix` Issue

The `_coord_matrix` function likely generates coordinate mappings for how inputs map to outputs. When dealing with nested compound models, it probably:

1. Doesn't correctly account for the offset of input/output indices
2. Treats the nested compound model as a single block instead of properly expanding its internal structure
3. Fails to properly translate the coordinate system of the nested model into the parent model's coordinate system

## Expected Fix

The fix would involve:

1. **In `_cstack`**: When combining matrices where one or both are already computed separability matrices from compound models, properly position them with the correct offsets.

2. **In `_coord_matrix`**: When generating coordinates for nested models, recursively expand the coordinate mappings rather than treating compound models as opaque blocks.

3. **Proper offset calculation**: Keep track of the cumulative input/output offsets as we traverse the model tree.

## Demonstration of the Bug Pattern

The all-True matrix in the buggy case suggests that the algorithm is falling back to a conservative "everything depends on everything" approach when it can't properly compute the separability for nested models. This is likely a deliberate safety mechanism to avoid incorrect optimizations, but it results in overly pessimistic separability information.
