 ``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS``
 ---------------------------
-
-.. versionchanged:: 2.1
-
-    The behavior of ``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`` was clarified.
-
-If your file upload settings allow users to upload files, you are **strongly**
-encouraged to set this value to something sensible for your environment. The
-default of ``None`` may result in inconsistent permissions for uploaded files,
-depending on the upload handler and the ``umask`` of your process.
-
-On most platforms, files uploaded with
-:class:`~django.core.files.uploadhandler.TemporaryFileUploadHandler` will be
-saved with permissions of ``0o600``. Files uploaded with
-:class:`~django.core.files.uploadhandler.MemoryFileUploadHandler` will have
-permissions determined by your process's ``umask``.
-
-By default, Django uses a combination of these handlers. Small files are
-processed in memory, and large files are written to disk. This means that the
-size of a user's upload will determine the permissions of the saved file.
-
-Setting this value to ``0o644`` (or ``0o640``) is often desirable. This ensures
-that uploaded files are readable by the user running the Django application, and
-optionally by other members of the user's group.
+ 
+.. versionchanged:: 3.0
+ 
+    The default value of ``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`` was changed to ``0o644``.
+ 
+By default, Django saves uploaded files with permissions of ``0o644``. This
+ensures that uploaded files are readable by the user running the Django
+application, and readable by other users. If you need different permissions,
+you can change this setting. For example, ``0o640`` would make files readable
+only by the user running the Django application and members of its group.
+ 
+If you set this to ``None``, you will get operating-system dependent behavior
+which may result in inconsistent permissions for uploaded files, depending on
+the upload handler and the ``umask`` of your process. On most platforms, files
+uploaded with
