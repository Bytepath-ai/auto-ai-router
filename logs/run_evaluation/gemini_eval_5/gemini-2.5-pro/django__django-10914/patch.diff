+Settings
+========
+
+* The default value of the :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting is
+  changed from ``None`` to ``0o644``. This change provides more consistent
+  permissions for uploaded files with different upload handlers. To restore
+  the previous behavior, set ``FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`` to ``None``.
